KNOCK-KNOCK,"There is a wooden house standing in the thick of the forest. A single man resides there. As of late the house is visited by unusual Guests which knock on the window shutters inviting the hermit to take part in a game of hide-and-seek. The winning condition is simple, you have to remain alive and to retain your sanity till sunrise. This means that approaching the Visitors head-on might be a terrible idea.

There is an unusual cabin deep in the woods. It had served as a laboratory and a dwelling for three generations of Lodgers.

But as of late the latest Lodger has been noticing weird changes in familiar surroundings; things are missing, noises and rattle heard. Something odd is coming out of the woods. Come night, it seems like someone's made himself at home in the twilight of rooms, attics, and cellars.

You need to stay awake and sane till dawn.

The Lodger is wandering the rooms, evading the unknown, counting minutes till morning. But it's only in the night that he can solve the main puzzle and find the answers. What's going on? Are the Guests real, ot are they just figments of his insomniac imagination? What'd happened to the forest? What's happening to the cabin? Is there a line between reality and imagination?

In late November, 2011, a strange and troubling event has happened to our studio. We have received an anonymous e-mail which suggested that we should produce some ""unconventional"" game based upon the materials attached to the letter. Such offers are a dime a dozen and most of the time they barely deserve any attention at all, however, this one seemed quite different.

The attachment contained a set of 19 files added to an archive titled ""lestplay"". The files (snippets of text, scraps of audio recording, video footage fragments) as well as the style and wording of the message itself appeared to be rather disturbing. The surface examination did not reveal anything straightforwardly terrifying, yet we could not escape the feeling that something truly sinister was lurking underneath.

The stranger was begging us to complete the project he has started, yet he also made us well aware of the risk we took as the proposed ludic situation would potentially explain what calamity befell whoever has compiled the ominous archive, thus urging ourselves to meet the same fate.

The unknown Author was a gentleman and a scholar - he stated that he would introduce no boundaries to our creative freedom, yet he insisted that along with the ludic situation itself the items forming the ""lestplay"" archive should be included into the game, ""else everything would be futile"".

Alongside a significant number of others, we tend to lend a certain amount of credibility to mysticism, yet this specific predicament seemed more like a shoddy mystification. We were fed up with a massive number of similar ""cursed files"" tricks and at times we felt inclined to erase the whole thing for good.

However, upon consideration, we still decided to take part in this experiment. At the very least we would find out what the result would be, and what awful fate would possibly await us, as we will obviously be the first people to play the game.
-Hide! Play hide-and-seek with denizens of your nightmares.

ROMANCING SAGA 2,"Romancing SaGa 2, originally released only in Japan in 1993, has been completely remastered and now receives its first ever official English translation!

No two players will experience the story in the same way

The SaGa series is one of Square Enix's most beloved. The first three titles were originally branded overseas under the ""FINAL FANTASY LEGEND"" moniker , and garnered critical acclaim for their complex yet compelling combat system.

Romancing SaGa 2 takes the varied gameplay of other entries in the series and combines it with an open-ended free-form scenario system whose story is as vast as the world in which it plays out. The player takes the role of a succession of emperors, painting the history of the world with each and every action.

Familiar series hallmarks such as formations and glimmers make a return in this unique title.

Story

It all begins with the song of a lone bard in a bustling pub.

Great nations such as the Varennes Empire, which had once ensured peace throughout the world, stagnated and atrophied over the course of centuries, and sinister forces started emerging in outlying areas.

Ere long, peace spiraled into war and the common folk spoke in hushed words of the Seven Heroeshistorical figures who saved the world once and who, it was hoped, would do so again.

Additional Elements

*New dungeons
*New classes: diviner and ninja
*New Game+
*Autosave
*UI specifically designed for smartphones

ROOT DOUBLE: BEFORE CRIME * AFTER DAYS - XTEND EDITION,"The year is 2030. Business is as usual in the isolated research city of Rokumei–that is until several explosions suddenly go off in the nuclear research facility known as “LABO.” The city sends in “Sirius,” an elite rescue squad, to deal with the situation. But the situation only gets worse when LABO’s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown–with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset.

The story of Root Double features two different protagonists: Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain who has lost his memories in the hours after the incident, and Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a student piecing together the clues in the six days before. The only key to survival lies in the player’s hands with the Senses Sympathy System (SSS). Unlike traditional visual novels, Root Double does not have clear cut “choices,” but rather, the game uses SSS to allow the player to manipulate the story based purely upon emotion. Your emotions projected upon the characters, particularly your trust in them, shape the progression of the story. Only with effective use of this system and completion of both protagonists’ stories can the player piece together the truth and hope to discover a way out of the facility.","Genre(s): Adventure, Visual Novel",N/A,tbd,Yeti,PlayStation Vita,"Mar 13, 2018",N/A

SENSE: A CYBERPUNK GHOST STORY,"Dystopian sci-fi gets a survival horror twist!

In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse.

TACHYON PROJECT,"In Tachyon Project you take control of Ada, a software program that has taken conscience and that was designed to hack into the most secure servers on Earth. After some rather misterious events, Ada is thrown out of the test server where it was living and out into the Internet, but when she tries to go back there she finds she's unable to. She'll then start a journey to uncover the truth behind what happened to her creators, which she considers her parents. In the process she'll find out that things were a bit more complex than she initially thought.

Tachyon Project is a dual stick shooter where we've taken concepts from the classic shoot'em up genre and tried to adapt them to the dual stick shooter genre. In Tachyon Project the player will find the gameplay versatility and speed traditional to dual stick shooters but with the variability in weapons and enemies that you usually find in shoot'em ups. The variety of weapons, secondary weapons and perks allow for hundreds of combinations for your ship. That, along with the number of different enemy types provides a lot of gameplay variety that is something quite unique in the genre.

Tachyon Project also brings new ideas to the table, presenting a new stealth mode in some levels where you have to pick carefully when to shoot to avoid being discovered too early and keep yourself disguised.

The game provides an interesting story mode where you go unlocking new weapons, secondary weapons and perks as you progress and uncover the story behind Ada's creation. But you can also play on challenges that present you with unending hordes of enemies to try for the best score and compete in leaderboards. You can play these challenges either alone or with friends in up to 4 player local multiplayer co-operative games.","Genre(s): Action, Shooter, Shoot-'Em-Up, Top-Down",N/A,tbd,Eclipse Games,PlayStation Vita,"Mar 29, 2016",N/A

VOSTOK INC.,"Vostok Inc. is a casual game for a hardcore audience and a hardcore game for a casual audience. The premise is that you're a corrupt, narcissistic yuppie, out to make as much money as possible. Think the Wolf of Wall Street... in Space.

It's a twin stick shooter for the modern age, an age where audiences are limited by time and want to be able to play when they want, how they want, and on whatever devices they want. Want to play on console whilst sitting on the sofa? Sure. Fancy a quick game on handheld whilst on the bus? Go ahead. Want the game to reward you whilst it's playing itself, on your mobile whilst at work? Don't let us stop you!

The introduction of an idle clicker metagame into an already brilliant and satisfying second-to-second experience adds a whole extra dimension to the genre. Not to mention it makes the game more addictive than crack once you get going.

Of course no Nosebleed Interactive game would be complete without the extra bells and whistles, so as well as an adaptive audio system (which you can remix to your heart's content) we've also got 13 minigames (including an FPS), Tamagotchi style virtual pets (or in our case, a Virtual Executives), and a massive suite of ship and weapon upgrades to unlock and mess about with.","Genre(s): Action, Shooter, Shoot-'Em-Up, Top-Down",N/A,tbd,Nosebleed Interactive,PlayStation Vita,"Sep 22, 2017",N/A
