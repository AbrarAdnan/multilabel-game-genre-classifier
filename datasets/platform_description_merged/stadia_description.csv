BORDERLANDS 3: DIRECTOR'S CUT,"Meet Hemovorous the Invincible: a gargantuan Varkid who drops some of the best loot in the game (provided you can actually kill her). Hemovorous has made her lair behind a previously sealed door on Pandora, and Director’s Cut is your chance to go toe-to-pincer with this monstrous enemy. If you’ve completed the main story campaign and own Director’s Cut, you’ve earned the right to take on Hemovorous. Get your group to pony up 500 Eridium to open the door and you can shoot your shot against this deadly behemoth. This raid boss fight provides one of the greatest end-game challenges veteran Vault Hunters can find—especially since her fearsome strength scales with both your character level beyond 35 and your active Mayhem Mode level. Better bring some friends and be ready to get caked in Varkid guts—it’s going to get messy!

Special guest Randy Varnell, head of the Gearbox Story Group, returned to The Borderlands Show to delve into the details of these new missions. The making of Ava’s Mysteriouslier podcast isn’t all running and gunning (though you can expect plenty of gore-soaked firefights along the way). To help solve this string of seemingly paranormal happenings, you’ll sometimes need to stop and take stock of a crime scene and deduce your next steps based on environmental clues. What you find will send ripples throughout the rest of Borderlands 3’s story, but we’ll let you solve those mysteries yourself. Director’s Cut also includes a bounty of behind-the-scenes content from the making of Borderlands 3, including a gallery full of concept art, storyboards, lost maps, and footage from throughout the game’s development. It’s a fascinating glimpse into Borderlands 3’s beginnings, bloopers, and cut content that shaped the game.","Genre(s): Action, Shooter, First-Person, Arcade",N/A,8.4,Gearbox Software,Stadia,"Apr 18, 2021",N/A

RELICTA,"Relicta is a first-person puzzle game whose main mechanics combine magnetism and gravity. The player is equipped with a pair of special gloves that allow them to change the magnetic and gravitational properties of experimental cubes scattered around each level. These cubes can be moved by the player, either carrying them bodily or using magnetism or gravity. They can also be placed on teleporting machines to warp them to another teleporter and help solve puzzles. Mechanics really come alive when combined in ingenious ways. For instance, magnetism can be used to repel or attract cubes, but repelling a cube that has previously “anti-gravitated” gives you a frictionless device that will retain inertia until it collides against something solid, like a wall (or your skull). It can even be used as a means of transport for the player to reach new places. Cubes can also be used to power up some devices, in order to operate doors and force fields. As the player progresses towards more complex puzzles, they will encounter other devices - magnetic plates, elevators, buttons or even drones capable of nullifying magnetic and gravitational fields as well as stealing cubes.","Genre(s): Adventure, 3D, First-Person",N/A,6.8,Mighty Polygon,Stadia,"Aug 4, 2020",M

This is how we try to survive. Through the darkest of times.

You are the leader of a small resistance group in 1933's Berlin, of ordinary people, from Jews to Catholics and Communists to Patriots who simply can't stand aside. Your goal is to deal with small blows to the regime dropping leaflets to spread awareness about what the Nazis are really up to among the people, painting messages on walls, sabotaging, gathering information and recruiting more followers. And all of that while staying undercover if the regime's forces learn about your group, the life of each member is in grave danger.
