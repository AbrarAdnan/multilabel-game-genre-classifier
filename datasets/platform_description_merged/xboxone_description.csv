This deluxe collection brings you every stage from both of famously tough action platform games, remixed & re-balanced plus an all-new, never-before-seen final chapter to bring the experience together for the ultimate experience in nerd rage.

Featuring...

Enhanced Visuals!
Experience the 8-bit ugliness in a whole new way!

Updated Game Engine!
And by updated, we mean ""Rebuilt the first game from the ground up in the superior second game's engine."" Trust us, it feels better.
Improved level design and difficulty options!
Both games are infamously hard-as-nails, but Normal and Easy difficulties come with infinite lives, so take as many attempts as you need to beat the challenge. Level designs have been improved upon to really nail the balance between tough and fair.
Or perhaps you loved the limited lives and ludicrous overuse of instant-death blocks in the original release? We've got you covered. Just select ""Old School"" or higher from the difficulty menu and you'll be cursing the developers' name in no time.

Quality of Life Improvements!
Faster respawning (When you die, which will be often, you'll just pop right back out of the Toaster and get on with your day, just like nature intended!), multiple save slots, accessibility options and more mean that anybody can take on the challenge.

Surprises!
Perhaps you've never played either of these games, perhaps you're new to the sequel, or maybe you have spent years achieving the world speedrun record for both, but whatever your experience with the series, there are plenty of surprises in store for you!

New Chapter, Completing The Story!

Game Flow
Battle through stages filled with fearsome enemies and dangerous traps, each with a massive boss waiting at the end. A chance encounter with a potential ally awaits you after defeating a boss. Will they serve as a trustworthy partner on your perilous journey?

Increase Combat Abilities
You can instantaneously switch between allies you have recruited at any time! Allies have their own life bars, so with each ally you recruit, you're survivability is greatly increased!

Shortcuts that Only Allies Can Access
Allies have special, unique abilities which allow them to use shortcuts to skip parts of stages or access new areas! There are no special items obtainable by taking the long way around, so take every shortcut you can find! If your allies are out of commission, you'll have to take longer routes, where stronger enemies await! When your life gets low, be sure to switch then out so they'll be available when you need them.

Multiple Episodes
The story is told over the course of multiple episodes. Only the first episode is accessible at the beginning, but more episodes will unlock as you progress through the game. The events that unfold in each episode continue into the next one, so be sure to unlock all the episodes to see the true ending.

The Oni
Heir to a famous Japanese swordsmanship school, Kazan Yamaoka sought to surpass his reputation as a warrior by turning his back on honor and family and embarking on a dark pilgrimage of bloodlust. As he waged his personal war against self-proclaimed samurai, he was bestowed with the derogatory and despised nickname of Oni-Yamaoka, a reference to the hideous creature of legend. One day, he met his fate as his former victims took revenge on him. It drew the Entity's attention and he was deemed worthy of becoming part of its world, joining the other killers there, but ironically under the very form he had been compared to in his former life.

The Oni's Power: Yamaoka's Wrath

The desire to destroy weaker bloodlines shaped into a literal force. The Oni absorbs blood orbs left by injured Survivors. Once he's collected enough orbs of blood, The Oni enters BLOOD FURY mode.

Quick, daring and superstitious, Yui Kimura was one of the youngest motorcyclists to break records in unsanctioned street races as well as the very prestigious Moto Grand Prix of Japan. Breaking with tradition and against her parents' wishes, she left her home to pursue her dreams of racing and led a gang helping women in troubled situations. Until she found herself roped into another endless race where crossing the finish line was a matter of life and death.

Yui comes with 3 new perks.

Lucky Break

DEAD BY DAYLIGHT: CURTAIN CALL,"People often speak of the tears of a clown, of the sadness that lies beneath the greasepaint smile.

A mind that sees others only as vessels for torture, and reduces their bodies down to a single finger, a trophy to be added to a collection? For something like that to survive, it would have to wear a disguise, cloak itself in a brighter aspect and a broad smile, even if it were just painted on.

Kate Denson's smile is genuine, friendly and warm. She sings of love and life, family and hope. She holds those values dear, and will fight anyone who tries to destroy them.

Carnival of Souls
Carnivals are places of fun and laughter, of color and light, beacons of happiness in the dark. Make sure not to walk too far from the crowds and music, to be lured by the painted panels and inviting light of that lonely caravan, or you just might find one of your fingers added to the Clown's collection.

Macabre Mementos
The Clown has long used his nomadic lifestyle as a cover for his twisted pastimes. He distanced himself from a society that hated and feared him, living as a parasite, enticing those who strayed too near, anesthetizing and trapping them like butterflies. Beware, if you feel your senses dulling and your head getting light, RUN!

DEAD BY DAYLIGHT: DARKNESS AMONG US,"The everyday contains many hazards. But the comforts of routine shroud the unfathomable risks of a threat so intimate, so familiar, that it can only be seen in hindsight. A disturbing, violent force could be raging within the people closest to you. Darkness is among us, every day.

The raw cravings and impulses of adolescence are powerful. The desire to belong can be just as unbelievably strong. When three teens get involved with an impulsive mastermind, they discover an addictive kind of freedom. Together, they spiral out of control and become the wrong kind of crowd, The Legion, leaving no rule unbroken. The Darkness Among Us chapter includes Frank and Julie as playable killers.

NEW SURVIVOR: JEFF JOHNSON

The Artist with a Heart of Gold
Born and raised in Ormond, Alberta, Jeff Johansen grew up as a quiet, only child with an aversion for large crowds. During high school, his anxious temper was mislabelled as shyness, which he covered up with a tough, stoic persona that intimidated bullies and teachers alike.
At home, he collected heavy metal vinyl albums. The evocative symbolism on the covers inspired him to make art of his own, which helped him cope with his parents' constant fighting.
After his parents' divorce, he was forced to move with his mother to Winkler, Manitoba, miles away from his hometownand his dad. In Winkler, Jeff was more isolated than ever, except for art and music. His solace came shortly after graduating high school when he started working at a local bar with live music. He found a roadie gig shortly after and left Winkler for good.
After an incident at a concert, he reoriented himself and started designing labels for microbreweries. He led a quiet, simple life brewing beer, designing tattoos, and making art for bands he liked.
All until one morning, when he got a phone call from Ormond saying that his father had passed, leaving a few things to sort out. Jeff returned to the home he left behind, but he should have never looked back.
Jeff's personal perks, Breakdown, Aftercare, and Distortion, allow him to break hooks, cooperate with other Survivors, and conceal his aura from The Killer.

Surrounded by an impressive mountain range, Ormond's ski slopes showed promise for a lucrative coal mining venture. The environmentally controversial nature of the project, however, brought the enterprise to an abrupt stop, which left deep scars on Ormond's landscape and population. The hollowed summit of Mount Ormond now looms over desolate patches of dead trees, a soulful, deforested graveyard where gangs and teenagers go looking for trouble. Some people say that the mountain hides a darkness, a bottomless hole from where no one can return. The abandoned ski facilities still remind the inhabitants of a past that never was. It is a place of broken promises and devastated nature. The stale air worsens during winter, when the rough winds drape a heavy blanket of isolation over the bleak landscape.

DEAD BY DAYLIGHT: GHOST FACE,"Acquaintances are a dangerous deception. Our workplace is filled with them; strangers beside us, five days a week. A distant familiarity grown from habit; the blanks filled with assumptions as we forget how little we know, until proven otherwise.

The Ghost Face took full advantage of the fact. His entourage at the newspaper could have spotted that the Roseville murders led to him. There were clues: the days he missed work, the victims' time of death, and the detailed articles he wrote citing sources he never shared. But his coworkers did not see. The Ghost Face blended into the everyday. No one thought the man seated on their left could be responsible for the murder of a dozen people. Until proven otherwise.
In the end, The Ghost Face would have gotten away with it as he had before: he would have packed his bags when the investigation pointed in his direction, driven a few miles, and looked for another job. But this time he found a richer hunting ground

The Ghost Face
At first glance, Jed Olsen was a kind and enthusiastic freelancer with experience at various small newspapers. He was hired at the Roseville Gazette, whose staff appreciated how easy-going he seemed. Olsen didn't have to justify his erratic career path, which zigzagged between Utah and Philadelphia. He had a good attitude and a decent portfolio, which showed he'd covered serious news such as unsolved murders. Most importantly, he was ready to start right away.

Five months later, the Roseville Murders began: victims ranging from young to old, stabbed to death in their homes. The whole staff was working the story.
The number of victims surged as Olsen worked the story. To heighten the swelling panic in Roseville, Olsen produced the footage of a hooded figure breaking into a house at night. Olsen's masked face, a white blur in the dark, stared at the camera for a second, before disappearing inside. ""The Ghost Face Caught on Tape"" was the title Olsen gave the article. He was proud of his work, enjoying how the whole town now feared a ghost story.
When the investigation started to point in his direction, he left Roseville swiftly. He had written and collected a dozen of articles, all of which fed his legend. Finding a satisfying challenge next would be difficult, yet opportunity found him.

The Ghost Face's Power: Night Shroud
The Ghost Face liked to stalk his victims. He'd follow them from the local bar, snapping pictures of them at home while looking for a way in. He could study the same victim for weeks, meticulously registering their habits. He'd return when the urge swelled inside him, too great to ignore. By then he knew exactly what to do. While the Night Shroud is active: The Ghost Face's Terror Radius shrinks to nil. Under these conditions, The Ghost Face becomes Stealth, as long as he stays unseen from all Survivors. The Ghost Face can stalk Survivors to find their vulnerabilities, making them exposed for a limited time.

Leatherface is not only the skin clad maniac with a disturbed mind. He seeks acceptance and appreciation. He's learned the hard way and was molded to what he now is. A watchdog, a guardian, a blind gate keeper who never questions. And all problems can be solved with his chainsaw.

These creatures were labeled ""Demogorgons"" by a group of local kids who encountered them.

It's this newfound loyalty to his friends that compels Steve to come to the aid of his ex-girlfriend, Nancy when he suspects she might be in terrible danger...

NEW SURVIVOR: DAVID KING

Rookie of the Year
David King is not unique. Not unique when it comes to talent being destroyed by anger. Strength and speed was easy for David. He took up rugby to let out some steam. He had a knack for it. Quickly he rose to fame and people saw a grand career on the rise. But being fueled by rage instead of something positive will thwart yourself. So alcohol and bar fights became his life instead. Still trying to focus internal anger...somewhere. Soon a whole career was gone. But David kept fighting. Illegally and without protection. Friends saw less and less of him, and one day he was gone. He still holds an athletic body and a lot of anger. But now he's facing something he's never fought before - something that won't die.

SURVIVOR PERKS

David King comes with 3 new Perks.

David King

NEW MAP: RED FORREST -- MOTHER'S DWELLING

An old cottage in the woods
A home is a home for someone, somewhere. Even though others might see something horrid and scary, this cottage was once filled with love. But when loves leaves a place, there is only emptiness to fill the void. The dwelling is slowly merging with the rest of the surrounding woods. Going back to its true roots. Lumber to tree. Flickering candles can be seen late some nights, and as the wind settles, a strange melody can be heard - humming throughout the night. This seemingly abandoned place does hold guests. One willingly and many, many others by force, and outback, bodies are buried. One might stumble upon the cottage, but would feel an urgent desire to leave. To go back to something that provides warmth. The old dwelling in the forest is the opposite. It provides nothing but cold, dark, loneliness and screams that are destroyed by the wind.","Genre(s): Action Adventure, Survival"

Story:
In a far future, Earth was devastated by mutants who took control after a worldwide catastrophic event known as ""the big pulse"", a global scale electromagnetic pulse that put an end to all electronic technology on the planet. Humans are now enslaved by mutants led by ""The Boss"" in a world ruled by ""the law of the jungle"".
However, not everything is lost two humans and a mutant rebel are willing to fight in order to stop this madness. Will they be strong enough? Well... that's up to you!

Main Characters:
Gal: A girl who escaped from traders of humans. She's an expert in her own kick-boxing-derived martial art. While her attacks don't have a long reach, her speed and agility have no equal and her technique and endurance are pretty good too. She is capable of avoiding almost every attack, an ability that comes in handy when facing multiple foes.

Ricardo: A minotaur human-rights activist and a powerful wrestler. He's not very fast and his technique isn't as good as his comrades', but he has a pretty long reach, and his power and endurance are amazing. He's capable of destroying any enemy in record time!

F. Norris: A runaway ninja whose past is a mystery. He's the one who mastered the ninjutsu style known as ""the forbidden technique"". While he might be pretty fragile compared to Gal or Ricardo, he has a great combination of reach, power and speed, plus an amazing technique that (when mastered) can take control of any situation.

Story

A long time ago...

In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.
The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.
...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames,
a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.

The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.
Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.
And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.
While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.

In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.
To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.

You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins.

In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use theseand moreto your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!

In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills.

KNOCK-KNOCK,"There is a wooden house standing in the thick of the forest. A single man resides there. As of late the house is visited by unusual Guests which knock on the window shutters inviting the hermit to take part in a game of hide-and-seek. The winning condition is simple, you have to remain alive and to retain your sanity till sunrise. This means that approaching the Visitors head-on might be a terrible idea.

There is an unusual cabin deep in the woods. It had served as a laboratory and a dwelling for three generations of Lodgers.

But as of late the latest Lodger has been noticing weird changes in familiar surroundings; things are missing, noises and rattle heard. Something odd is coming out of the woods. Come night, it seems like someone's made himself at home in the twilight of rooms, attics, and cellars.

You need to stay awake and sane till dawn.

The Lodger is wandering the rooms, evading the unknown, counting minutes till morning. But it's only in the night that he can solve the main puzzle and find the answers. What's going on? Are the Guests real, ot are they just figments of his insomniac imagination? What'd happened to the forest? What's happening to the cabin? Is there a line between reality and imagination?

In late November, 2011, a strange and troubling event has happened to our studio. We have received an anonymous e-mail which suggested that we should produce some ""unconventional"" game based upon the materials attached to the letter. Such offers are a dime a dozen and most of the time they barely deserve any attention at all, however, this one seemed quite different.

The attachment contained a set of 19 files added to an archive titled ""lestplay"". The files (snippets of text, scraps of audio recording, video footage fragments) as well as the style and wording of the message itself appeared to be rather disturbing. The surface examination did not reveal anything straightforwardly terrifying, yet we could not escape the feeling that something truly sinister was lurking underneath.

The stranger was begging us to complete the project he has started, yet he also made us well aware of the risk we took as the proposed ludic situation would potentially explain what calamity befell whoever has compiled the ominous archive, thus urging ourselves to meet the same fate.

The unknown Author was a gentleman and a scholar - he stated that he would introduce no boundaries to our creative freedom, yet he insisted that along with the ludic situation itself the items forming the ""lestplay"" archive should be included into the game, ""else everything would be futile"".

Alongside a significant number of others, we tend to lend a certain amount of credibility to mysticism, yet this specific predicament seemed more like a shoddy mystification. We were fed up with a massive number of similar ""cursed files"" tricks and at times we felt inclined to erase the whole thing for good.

However, upon consideration, we still decided to take part in this experiment. At the very least we would find out what the result would be, and what awful fate would possibly await us, as we will obviously be the first people to play the game.

-Don't look now! The goal of each night is to reach dawn while still sane.

-Seek. The Lodger has lost something very important. The reason for what is happening is somewhere inside. Everything that is happening can be explained, you only need to find the key and bring it to light.
-Wait. In this game you need to watch and listen carefully. Inspect and scrutinize. You only have to last until the sunrise.
-Follow the rules of the game! Of course you must first understand the game being played with you.","Genre(s): Miscellaneous, Adventure, General"

LA-MULANA 2,"La-Mulana 2 features sprawling ancient ruins, mind-boggling mysteries, untold numbers of items, and terrible enemies combining to form what is possibly the perfect Metroidvania-style ""archaeological ruin exploration action game"".

In La-Mulana 2, you take on the role of Lumisa Kosugi - daughter of the previous title's hero - as she explores the ancient ruins of La-Mulana, said to be the cradle of human civilization. Desperate to find the cause of the numerous recent appearances of monsters from the ruins, Lumisa heads to the ""other"" La-Mulana: the ruins known as Eg-Lana.

Explore the vast ruins comprising multiple field maps, solve mysteries and riddles using the stone tablets and messages you discover along the way, and take out huge monsters known as ""Guardians"" as you make your way to the deepest depths of the ruins.

You won't believe the awesome mystery of Eg-Lana awaiting you at the end of your journey...

ABOUT LA-MULANA 2:
La-Mulana was known as a ""Metroidvania""-style game (a 2D action platformer with an emphasis on non-linear exploration). That said, the real core of the game is in deciphering the riddles scattered throughout the game, and solving the puzzles that exist as part of the ruins.

A classic experience: As with its predecessor, La-Mulana 2 will not feature a tutorial or a long-winded sidekick. As a seasoned explorer, it's up to you to discover the secrets hidden within the ruins and find the truth on your own.

Explore at your own pace: By deciphering cryptic text on the monuments scattered throughout the ruins, you will gradually unravel the mystery of the ruins. Which parts of the sprawling underground you tackle, and in what order, is up to you. Sometimes you will need to use changes in backgrounds, mysterious sounds, the strength of enemies, or the sneakiness of traps to detect subtle changes in your surroundings.

A colossal adventure: We have designed a variety of zones, and have created a mystery deep enough to encompass a gigantic cave system. This is a very large-scale indie title. We predict newcomers to the series will probably be able to clear the game in 20 to 30 hours. Because of the non-linear nature of Eg-Lana, La-Mulana 2 will have plenty of replayability.

New horrors, new weapons: Plenty of ferocious and terrifying monsters and guardians stand in your way in the depths of this new underground network. Fortunately, you will also have an arsenal of tools and weapons at your disposal to help you on your journey.

Widescreen support: The first La-Mulana was a remake of a retro-style game that ran in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which made widescreen support impossible. For La-Mulana 2, the various maps and rooms are designed to be 16:9-compatible, making it perfect for widescreen TVs and monitors.

The question we've asked ourselves throughout development is: ""How can we make an old-school 2D game take advantage of advancements in present-day technology?""

* Lemeza Kosugi (36 years old; the previous game's protagonist)
Tales of his exploits in the ruins of La-Mulana may be known worldwide, but he was also responsible for the ruins' destruction, and has gone into hiding as a result. His love of exploration has not faded, however, and he still finds time to go spelunking in secret.

* Shawn Kosugi (67 years old)
After revealing the ""Treasure of All Life"" he brought back from the ruins of La-Mulana, he returned to a hermetic life once more. Although he technically retired after finishing his research on the ""Cradle of All Civilization"", he finds himself slowly drawn back into the world of archaeology.

* Elder Xelpud (Age unknown)
Upon the collapse of the La-Mulana ruins, his life as a 7th Child came to an end. He's been spending his time running the ""La-Mulana Ruins Tourist Spot"" in hopes of finding purpose in life once again. As a result, he's become quite wealthy, and now lives a life of luxury full of beautiful women and fast cars.

* Mulbruk (3024 years old; looks/hopes to look about 24)

Challenge yourself to think across four dimensions as you embark on the ultimate test of cognition and combat.

Matches in Lemnis Gate take place within time loops. You have 25 seconds to execute your action, be it blasting an enemy, manoeuvring your operative, or setting up your next move. After all players have taken turns, the next 25-second round begins. Now you’ll face what has happened while setting up what will happen. Each of the five rounds is your chance to alter the timeline as past, present, and future converge.

STRATEGIC COMBAT IN THE FOURTH DIMENSION
Victory doesn’t rely on shooting supremacy. You’ll have to use skill and strategy to create unstoppable game plans and get the drop on opponents. It’s all about non-linear logic, abstract thinking, and outlandish manoeuvres. Execute audacious acts and think several moves ahead to get the win.

A TIME-BENDING TACTICAL SHOOTER
With a varied cast of characters to choose from, how you play is up to you. Lay damaging toxic waste in your enemy’s path, slow time to land the perfect shot, or deploy protective orbs to assist your future self. Every operative possesses a distinctive loadout and special ability that proves decisive on the battlefield.

TEAM UP WITH YOURSELF
Welcome to the team comprised entirely of one: you. With Lemnis Gate’s innovative auto co-op feature, you command every member of your side. Auto co-op gives you total control of five deep-space operatives, effectively enabling two competitors to duke it out in bustling ten-character matches. Become a literal one-person army.

COUNTLESS POSSIBILITIES, ENDLESS OUTCOMES
From the first second to the last, anything can happen in Lemnis Gate. Each round is a fresh chance to implement an unbeatable new strategy – or earn redemption from an earlier error. Predict hostiles’ routes, infiltrate enemy lines, and develop multi-layered gameplans by co-operating with yourself. Experiment both in and outside time, and get creative with causality.","Genre(s): Action, Shooter, First-Person, Arcade"

"MAFIA III: FASTER, BABY!","Faster, Baby! features high-octane chases ripping through the countryside and new ways to cause vehicular mayhem. What’s different this time around when you play Mafia III? We’re getting straight to the action as we tell Lincoln’s tale. Faster, Baby! takes place alongside events in the game… but in an entirely new town and with new gameplay experiences. A civil rights leader is murdered while investigating local sheriff, Walter “Slim” Beaumont. Other activists are next on the list – and it’s up to Lincoln and Roxy Laveau (daughter of Charles “The Voice” Laveau) to get to the bottom of what’s happening. As for Sinclair Parish – it may be fictional, but it’s based upon how a few towns used to be, says Hangar 13’s Narrative Director, Bill Harms. It’s a place where some folks tried to preserve a narrow-minded way of life. Minorities weren’t welcome, especially after dark. “Just like the main game, we wanted to capture a snapshot of a specific time and place in American history, and let the player experience it.” Since Sinclair Parish is a small rural township in the countryside near the Bayou, expect lots of opportunities to tear through turns, jump gaps and run from the law. Harms adds, “The gameplay is really centered around driving and pushing that as far as possible, while also feeling like a natural extension of the free racing DLC we released not too long ago.” [2K Games]","Genre(s): Action Adventure, Open-World"

You’re in charge of every element of the journey into space: success rides on your decisions.

Will you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet?

Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies?

Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars.

Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors.

Launching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment.

These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue?

Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency.

MY CHILD LEBENSBORN,"Set in Norway after World War II, a few thousand children were born to Norwegian women, fathered by occupying soldiers from German. The Nazi regime viewed these children as, essentially, German, and launched a program called “Lebensborn” (Fount of Life) to raise and indoctrinate them, often in Germany. After the liberation of Norway and the defeat of the Nazis, the children were sent back to Norway. Often mothers gave up their children for adoption, but this only made things worse for those children. In My Child Lebensborn, you play as one of these adoptive parents, but parenting will be hard as your child grows up in a hostile and hateful environment.

This is a game rooted in the real-life experiences of Lebensborn children. We still can discover how hatred of our enemies continues to create victims even after victory. During one year, our child (here we take the girl Karin as example) begins the game in a state of high excitement. She’s about to attend local school for the first time. But her schooling experience turns out to be much tougher than she’d anticipated. The kids turn on Karin, bullying her because of her parentage. Although Karin herself is hazy about her biological parents, it is common knowledge in town that her father was a German soldier. We struggled with Karin’s emotional turmoil, as she faces bullying from children, adults and even teachers. She transforms from a happy girl, brimming with curiosity, to a sullen, distrustful child. The last thing is missing parents, but resulting in cold words and sarcasm from her grandparents, frustration and helplessness after knowing fatherhood. Before our moving to a new place with her father’s money, she insists to see the Norwegian king, but aboveboard is dangerous for her even though having Norwegian blood. At last, we get rid of the sad home and move to a new place.","Genre(s): Adventure, General"

It can even be used as a means of transport for the player to reach new places. Cubes can also be used to power up some devices, in order to operate doors and force fields.

Familiar series hallmarks such as formations and glimmers make a return in this unique title.

Great nations such as the Varennes Empire, which had once ensured peace throughout the world, stagnated and atrophied over the course of centuries, and sinister forces started emerging in outlying areas.

Ere long, peace spiraled into war and the common folk spoke in hushed words of the Seven Heroeshistorical figures who saved the world once and who, it was hoped, would do so again.

RORY MCILROY PGA TOUR,"Gameplay offers multiple ways to play, including arcade controls where the left stick is used to control power and accuracy, with the ability to add spin to the shot while the ball is in the air. In addition to the arcade controls, the return of 3-Click swings appeals to nostalgic gamers who prefer to set power and accuracy by tapping a button rather than moving a thumbstick. Those looking for an extra challenge can turn on Tour settings. When playing with Tour controls, the length of your backswing and speed of your follow through determine power, while the club path through the ball will be the most important factor in accounting for accuracy. Fans can also mix and match all three settings to create their own custom gameplay style. Courses themselves also affect how your shots are played, as firmer, links-style courses like St. Andrews provides more bounce and roll, while softer courses such as TPC Sawgrass have less bounce and be more receptive to spin.

SHADOWRUN RETURNS,"Jordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back and Shadowrun Returns (for Apple & Android tablets and PCs) is the game that Shadowrun fans have been waiting for a long time. A graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat, Shadowrun Returns is not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe that is beloved around the world.
Created almost 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game worlds origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of a Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of a Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.

Here's how it works:

According to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. Its part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them. As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of ""goblinization"", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.

Fast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technologya continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrixa network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporationsmonolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.

And moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves wont soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to.
Welcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.","Genre(s): Role-Playing, Strategy, Turn-Based, General, Tactics"

Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.

Command Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it's not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.

Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you're running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies.

Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems.

New in the Director's Cut
Standalone: Due to popular demand, Dragonfall is now a completely standalone title!

Revamped Combat System: The Dragonfall combat system has received a major overhaul. An all-new armor system adds another tactical layer to the experience, while refined cover and damage mechanics emphasize the importance of battlefield positioning. Complementing these improvements is an upgraded AI system which reacts more intelligently and accurately to your actions.

Redesigned Interface: The Dragonfall in-game interface has also been rebuilt. Spells, items and abilities are now much easier to access, while improved combat feedback allows you to fully understand the tactical situation in any given encounter.

Customize Your Team: Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities. In addition, if you don't like a team member's default spell, item or weapon loadout, you can now customize what they bring on each mission.

This unique ecosystem is a massive, procedurally generated land with unique animal AI, real-time world destruction, and organic exploration and puzzle design to create emergent gameplay that ensures no two playthroughs are ever the same.
Your Trebhums begin at the bottom of the natural food chain but can mutate and evolve with new physical attributes and abilities by eating a variety of flora and fauna. Discover and adapt dozens of mutations, including new traversal skills like flying and swimming to reach new areas, and new senses to help overcome puzzles, challenges and dangers. Your many Trebhums can each have different mutations, and new mutations don't replace ones you already have, letting you stack ability sets in dynamic ways.

New mutations allow players to explore new areas and each mutation stacks thus creating a truly expansive skill set which is constantly evolving.

* A Trebhum for everyone: Enjoy a virtually endless visual variety of Trebhum designs, as each mutation combine with one another to create surprising new creatures. This allows your herd to continue to evolve as players explore new areas and players can share the unique look of their Trebhum family with the rest of the world online.

THE VANISHING OF ETHAN CARTER,"The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person story-driven mystery game that focuses entirely on exploration and discovery. It contains no combat or explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you wont be able to see them.

You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethans home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into.

Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games.

Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters.

Still, the discoveries wont happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Pauls supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy.

Key Features:

As Edward pulls into the Golden Oak Motel, he is unaware just how much this night will change his life…

The horrors and darkness that thrive in the corner of every eye are torn loose…

Those Who Remain places you in an up-close, psychological horror story set in the sleepy town of Dormont – a town in a spiralling split from the fabric of reality, warped by darkness and the deeds of the Citizens who reside.

Confront the uncomfortable horrors reflected by the darkness and survive the night of Dormont as Edward is confronted with a test of his sanity, morality and the shadows of evil that lurks below.","Genre(s): Adventure, 3D, First-Person"

THROUGH THE DARKEST OF TIMES,"Dark times mean fear and risks. The risk to be caught by patrolling National Socialists, looking for people who publicly stand against their point of view. The risk of being beaten up or even killed by the German military because we're opposing the regime. The risk of losing everything, including our loved ones. This is how we live. This is how we try to survive. Through the darkest of times.

You are the leader of a small resistance group in 1933's Berlin, of ordinary people, from Jews to Catholics and Communists to Patriots who simply can't stand aside. Your goal is to deal with small blows to the regime dropping leaflets to spread awareness about what the Nazis are really up to among the people, painting messages on walls, sabotaging, gathering information and recruiting more followers. And all of that while staying undercover if the regime's forces learn about your group, the life of each member is in grave danger.

Through the Darkest of Times is a historical resistance strategy game, focusing on conveying the somber mood of the period and the very real struggles of average people living in the 3rd Reich. Historical accuracy means that your small group of resistance fighters will not change the outcome of the war, nor will you prevent all of the Nazi's atrocities, but you can certainly do everything in your power to save as many lives as you can and oppose the fascist system wherever possible.","Genre(s): Strategy, General"

WASTELAND 2: DIRECTOR'S CUT,"Wasteland 2 is the direct sequel to the first ever post-apocalyptic computer RPG. The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institutions current Art of the Computer Game exhibition.

Wasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more. It'll finally be the game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.","Genre(s): Role-Playing, Western-Style"

All the while, you'll have to decide who to trust in this land torn apart by corruption, intrigue, warring factions, crazed cultists, cutthroat gangs, and bitter sibling rivalries. Build a reputation for yourself by making decisions that will profoundly impact Colorado, its inhabitants and the story you experience. Will you be Colorado’s savior or its worst nightmare? Wasteland 3 is a squad-based RPG from inXile entertainment, featuring challenging tactical turn-based combat and a deep, reactive story full of twists, turns, and brutal ethical decisions that will keep you hooked whether you’re a Wasteland veteran or new to the series.

The workers are striking, bandits raid with impunity, and nobody is allowed through the gates, not even on the business of the Patriarch. Without help, Steeltown could crash and burn for good, and take Markham with it—but maybe that's just what it needs.
