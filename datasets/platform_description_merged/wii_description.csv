SOLITAIRE DUNGEON ESCAPE,"Rescue your princess using magic cards

Your princess is locked up in the last room of an intricate dungeon, guarded by a dragon. The keys to open the doors, are split in 16 parts. The only way to get these parts is solving a card game with magic cards. Let the adventure begin!

The card game consists in clearing the board by taking a card that is one above or below than the card on the deck.

Among the 160 levels available to play, you would find several missions. From level 6 you would have available a wild card, that you would be able to use any time replacing the card that you need. It's very useful for building long sequences. Each card taken off from the board has a value of 100 points, and if it follows a sequence then its value would have 50 bonus points. This means that the longer the sequence is then more points you get.","Genre(s): Miscellaneous, Board / Card Game",N/A,tbd,Jose Varela,Wii U,"Jun 18, 2015",N/A

She'll then start a journey to uncover the truth behind what happened to her creators, which she considers her parents. In the process she'll find out that things were a bit more complex than she initially thought.

Tachyon Project is a dual stick shooter where we've taken concepts from the classic shoot'em up genre and tried to adapt them to the dual stick shooter genre. In Tachyon Project the player will find the gameplay versatility and speed traditional to dual stick shooters but with the variability in weapons and enemies that you usually find in shoot'em ups. The variety of weapons, secondary weapons and perks allow for hundreds of combinations for your ship. That, along with the number of different enemy types provides a lot of gameplay variety that is something quite unique in the genre.

Tachyon Project also brings new ideas to the table, presenting a new stealth mode in some levels where you have to pick carefully when to shoot to avoid being discovered too early and keep yourself disguised.

The game provides an interesting story mode where you go unlocking new weapons, secondary weapons and perks as you progress and uncover the story behind Ada's creation. But you can also play on challenges that present you with unending hordes of enemies to try for the best score and compete in leaderboards. You can play these challenges either alone or with friends in up to 4 player local multiplayer co-operative games.","Genre(s): Action, Shooter, Shoot-'Em-Up, Top-Down",N/A,tbd,Eclipse Games,Wii U,"May 12, 2016",N/A

XTYPE PLUS,"Pure 2D blasting is what retro shooter, XType Plus, has in its gun sights, as it docks for download exclusively in Nintendo eShop on Wii U.

Youll need a sturdy trigger finger to survive this vertical blaster, as you pilot an insignificant vessel against an infinite series of randomly-generated bosses, each more difficult than the last. Its a simple mission: wipe out the enemy and dont get hit. The action kicks off with a laidback feel but very soon ramps up to hardcore proportions, where dodging is the key to survival. Lose your three lives, and its lights out.

As you battle on, youll come under relentless enemy fire from hulking, organic-looking ships. And XType Plus relishes every single shot, as huge patterns of bullets descend on your ship, leaving the slimmest of spaces to squeeze through. One blessing is your tiny hit box - only a direct impact to the core will take you out, although youll still need fighter-pilot reflexes and the eyes of a hawk to stay alive.

Beyond the blasting, XType brings fresh content in a supercharged Plus mode, exclusive to Wii U, pitting you against the clock, your lives exchanged for a countdown. Add in EMP bombs (electromagnetic pulse) and a larger enemy arsenal, and youve got tension on a plate.

Conquer that all-important high score for a badge of honour, then showboat with the best of them via the leaderboard system. Better yet, every high score you upload is accompanied by a video of your game, and other players will be able to watch your performance, good or bad! The upside is that you can also watch how the top ten players reach such lofty heights - they might just help your battle strategy in XType Plus, a lean, pared down and intense challenge for all Wii U shooter fans.

-Destroy an endless stream of bosses for the highest of high scores
-Blast against the clock in Plus Mode, new for Wii U

Comprised of only three distinct parts (colored sides, tentacles and life force), the focus of your rotozoan life is simple: grow your tentacles. After playing a few levels and learning the basics of your microscopic world, you begin to unlock additional modes of play and the ability to choose the number of tentacles on your rotozoan. Each mode has its own specific purpose: reach a particular length with your tentacles or grow them to the greatest length possible. In either mode, growing your tentacles means absorbing enemies known as goobugs by touching them. There's just one catch: Successfully absorbing a goobug depends on matching its color to your tentacle. Also, longer tentacles can more easily come in contact with incorrectly colored goobugs (causing damage to the tentacle and decreasing your life force), and the goobugs themselves multiply and begin adapting to your movement. Luckily, objects such as the restorative heart item and special attack-enabling cyclone item can be found floating in the ooze to help your rotozoan survive. With atmospheres ranging from peaceful to intensely challenging, Art Style: Rotozoa offers a wide variety of levels. Victory can only be achieved through quick, precise movement and the ability to remain calm under pressure. Are you ready to take on the goobugs?

JU-ON: THE GRUDGE,"The title is inspired by the Japanese classic horror movie, JU-ON, on which the American release of the hit horror film ""The Grudge"" was based upon. JU-ON: The Grudge for Wii is a Haunted House Simulator where accessibility and instant scares are given priority over all other game aspects, with the original creator of the movie, Takashi Shimizu, serving as a creative consultant to game development. It is said that when a person dies with a deep and burning grudge, a curse is born. When an average housewife in Nerima, Japan, was murdered in a grisly fashion, it gave rise to a curse so powerful that it threatens to kill at a pace thought unimaginable before. The curse manifests on those who encounter the curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed. Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free again. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, JU-ON: The Grudge has players move forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit hospital, and a mannequin factory. Much like a haunted house, the player must proceed forward even after being frightened and running away from the initial threat. As much fun as it is to get scared, sometimes it’s even more fun to watch others play to observe their reactions. For instant gratification, grab a second Wii Remote and push buttons to make in-game events happen immediately to make the player jump and hate you forever.

SILENT HILL: SHATTERED MEMORIES,"While the game shares its twisting plot with the original PlayStation game, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories takes a different path in many, many ways. Characters can be approached but offer different responses and be found in different places, while new clues and gameplay paths can be followed. The title follows Harry Mason, as he attempts to unravel the mystery of his missing daughter, Cheryl. A broken man, Mason’s investigations lead him to the mist-shrouded, snowy streets of Silent Hill: a malevolent town where the shadows play host to a wealth of evil, misshapen creatures. Designed to make full use of the Wii's unique controllers, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories uses the Wii Remote as a torch and cell phone as Mason looks for clues. The torch is vital for scouring the darkened, abandoned buildings of Silent Hill, while the phone acts as a secondary user interface, allowing the player to access maps via its GPS capabilities and take pictures of interesting elements. Likewise, the Wii Remote also can be used to pick up, examine and manipulate items to solve puzzles along the journey. Such technology was not available when the original Silent Hill was released in 1999, and its inclusion showcases Konami’s determination to enhance the playing experience with new, available technology. Also new to Shattered Memories is a psyche profile element, which monitors every aspect of player’s reactions - from where they explore first, items that have been examined, and their reaction to those they meet. Small visual elements will also be altered slightly, adding to the oppressing atmosphere where nothing is what it seems. The psyche profile will adapt Harry’s actions as and when he meets normal-looking people or the game's many inhuman denizens.
