1942: JOINT STRIKE,"[Playstation Network] 1942: Joint Strike takes inspiration and influence from the 194X series of World War II-themed vertical shooters. The art, sound, and gameplay of the new game takes cues from the original 194X games, but stands out as its own unique entry. Gameplay resembles the classic 2D style that gamers expect, but the game utilizes a full 3D engine. Set in a World War II-themed locale, stages, vehicles, and weapons have the look and feel of WWII with some stylistic differences. The world in which 1942 takes place is not our own and the events that transpire are not historically accurate, nor are they intended to be. This is an alternate world where history and technology developed along their own paths. As a result, players jump into the cockpits of WWII-era aircraft to take on huge waves of incoming enemy fire, dodging explosions and missiles while challenging huge bosses at the end of each stage. New co-op ""Joint Strike attacks"" combine the powers of two aircrafts into a devastating barrage.

Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more. A man-made floating city called the Ark, made up of hundreds of separate floating islands, is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental self-sufficient and 100% ""green"" habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth's oceans has forced the Ark to become a refuge for humanity. Crammed with the original Ark founders, their descendants, as well as tens of thousands of refugees, the Ark exists in total isolation from the rest of the world. With 25 years of social unrest, the inhabitants of the Ark have reached their breaking point. It's up to you to decide the future of the Ark and the human race. Blurring the Lines Between Offline and Online - Advance your character’s development across every gameplay mode: single player, co-op, and multiplayer. Gain experience points that you can spend on customizing and upgrading your skills and abilities, designing an entirely unique look and feel for your character. Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you're used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and takes advantage of a new feature: the SMART button. When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. No need to perfectly time a jump or vault, the game knows what you want to do. Objectives, communications, mission generation, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your status, your location, your squad-mates, and the status of the battle in all gameplay modes. You'll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success. Brink’s proprietary technology, Virtual Texturing, breaks new ground on current-gen consoles and PCs with an even greater focus on highly detailed characters, realistic environments, lighting, effects, and atmospherics. This competitive lead on the squad-combat genre helps thrust players into the gritty reality of the Ark's epic secluded arcology.

************************************************************
Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter is a console-quality hunting game which lets players explore huge non-linear locations as they attempt to track down a variety of dinosaurs that are armed with some of the most advanced AI on the platform. As a result, these are no “pea-brained” dinosaurs – these are dangerous creatures that are able to see, hear and sense the hunter. If you’re not careful, it’s very easy for the hunter to become the hunted.

With 15 different dinosaurs across 5 distinct environments including pine forests, muddy marshes and rolling hills, how you approach your target is important. Wind direction, scent and the use of a special dinosaur call are all key elements in tracking your prey.
Game Features:
• 3D dinosaurs, from the Herbivorous (plant eating) for novice hunters to the Carnivorous (meat-eating) for experts;
• Choose from among six different weapon types – from a sniper rifle to an X-bow;
• Utilize the map and radar feature to locate and track dinosaurs;
• 2 exciting game modes:
- Hunting: a non-linear hunting experience where players roam through vast landscapes, tracking and hunting a variety of dinosaurs;
- Survival: a timed, frenzied affair where dinosaurs begin rushing the player in an attempt to eat him. The pace starts slowly and builds, and the person who can stay alive the longest is the winner;
• Online leader boards and social networking integration;
• Interactive Dino Trophy Room.

Coming with updates:
- Ability to jump
- Blood
- Ammo supply
- Statistics and more...

Players assume the role of Dante, who descends into Hell after returning home to find his beloved Beatrice murdered, with Lucifer seducing her soul into the underworld. Dante sets out on a rescue mission to save Beatrice, but he soon realizes he is also in Hell to face his own demons and ultimately to redeem himself. Players take Dante through nine unique circles of Hell as mapped out and described by Alighieri: limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery. Each circle showcases its own distinct look, with demons, monsters, damned and geography that are crafted straight from the poem's vivid descriptions. To take down the demons of Hell, Dante is outfitted with two primary weapons: the Scythe he takes from Death and the Holy Cross given to him by Beatrice, which has spiritual powers that will help Dante collect souls and spells from the creatures he defeats on his journey. The game also features a deep upgrade system so gamers can customize their abilities to their specific gameplay style, something they'll need as Dante comes face to face with Hell's fiercest beasts and bosses. If successful, Dante will be able to tame certain beasts, exacting their will and turning Hell’s punishments back on itself.

FRACTURE,"Amidst a backdrop of worldwide ecological and seismological chaos in the mid-2100s, the United States has been split in two by the ""Great Flood"". As a result of the polar ice cap melting, the Mississippi River has destroyed the central portion of the United States, causing an ill-equipped Federal Government to fail and literally cutting the country in half. These two halves are left to fend for themselves in the aftermath. The East, now known as the Atlantic Alliance, symbolic of their union with Europe, puts its faith in surviving this new world in cybernetics, an established yet evolving technology now more than 150 years old. On the other side of the flooded continent, the Western states, now called the Republic of Pacifica and having allied with Asia, resort to solving their problems at the genetic level, effectively restructuring the DNA of its inhabitants -- a method the Atlantic Alliance finds morally reprehensible. By 2161, it only takes a hint of unauthorized military preparation in Pacifica for the newly restored president to order a strike in the heart of Pacifican territory -- an outpost in the now dry San Francisco Bay. This strike leads to the unthinkable: an epic conflict with global implications fought on U.S. soil. As a soldier in this struggle, Mason Briggs uses explosive, terrain-deforming weaponry to change the face of battle: He not only destroys the land in his path, he outright transforms it to gain the strategic advantage in completely unscripted ways no game has ever seen. With such a devastating arsenal at hand, Briggs never leaves any battlefield the way he found it. In addition to weaponry that allows players to do things previously only imagined, each side of the conflict, Pacifica and the Atlantic Alliance, boast soldiers with powers beyond those of ordinary men. Genetic augmentations provide Pacifican forces with amazing abilities, while Atlantic Alliance soldiers like Briggs counter the threat with the more ""traditional"" method: cybernetics. The differing states of superhumanity result in balanced yet stylistically different combat tactics that have never been seen before.

Krysae Sniper Rifle
This Turian antimaterial rifle is modified to kill Reaper enemies. The Krysaes scope uses a rangefinder that adjusts to keep the target in proper proportion to the shooter, which comes in useful when the sniper is forced into close range. Its specialized ammunition is both armor-piercing and explosive. In a desperate move, the Turians released

PAIN: SORE SPOTS,[Playstation Network] PAINalympics is my favorite new mode. I had a fight with our Vice President over our Relay event. He wanted me to change some things (not all of them I agreed with) and the conversation ended with me having to make other alterations to the mode to make it more fun. While sometimes Mr. Rohde is not my favorite BOSS he often has some valid points. PAINalympics is a much better mode because he decided to needle us until we got it right. Bull ride is a million times better since Rohde gave it his Caesar-esque thumbs down on the first iteration. The reason we decided to do a new add-on like Sore Spots is because you guys were up in arms about the lack of variety in the environments. Sometimes people don’t realize how much work goes into making one environment that does every mode. So instead we thought lets do two smaller ones and satisfy everyone’s need for variety. I think the new environments turned out rather well. There’s so much to do in these areas it’s just too fun! That area between 68 and 70 is my favorite.

Gameplay
Details

The defining feature of Quiplash is the ability to play using your phone, tabet, or computer as your controller. This not only eliminates the need for a bunch of controllers, it allows players to have a keyboard under their secret control with which they can input secret information. In addition, the game supports an audience of up to 10,000 players. Audience members can affect the vote (much like on a reality competition show on TV) even though they are not contestants. This feature allows extra players at large parties to still be involved in the game, and it allows viewer of streams of the game online to actually participate in the game they are watching streamed - even though the game is, technically, a local couch-play game. In all cases, players simply connect to jackbox.tv on their web-enabled controller (phone, tablet, etc.) and enter the 4-letter code unique to that game, and they are in. The first 8 players to log in are the players, and anyone after that becomes the audience.","Genre(s): Miscellaneous, Trivia / Game Show",,tbd,"Jackbox Games, Inc.",PlayStation 3,"Jun 30, 2015",

Imprisoned for millennia, its bonds have begun to weaken, and as they do, a shadow once again spreads across the surface of the world. Born into this world perched unknowingly on the brink of the apocalypse, a young man by the name of Leonhardt and his descendants are the last, best hope for Agarest. Their journey will span generations and continents as they strive to once again bring peace to their beleaguered world, even as the cost of their own souls.

RECORD OF AGAREST WAR 2,"One day, the world was enveloped by a mysterious blinding light. The destruction it caused was terrible, even as the light itself was sublime in its beauty, and it made those who witnessed the awesome display think of the unrestrained rage and fury of the divine.
The central continent, from where the light is believed to have originated from, went silent, while at the same time demons began to spread throughout the world like a plague. Amongst the survivors of the catastrophe, that fateful day became known as the ""Day of Light.""
Sometime after the events of the Day of Light, a young man by the name of Weiss, who had lost all memory of himself, encounters an enigmatic woman named Eva, who introduces herself as an Agent of the Divine. It is from her that Weiss learns that he has committed the grievous sin of deicide, and that in order for him to atone for his crime he is to become the ""Vessel"" in which the power of the divinity he had slaughtered will be stored. For it will be that power that will be used to resurrect the one whose life he stole.
For those who betray the divine will pay for their sins in the space which separates salvation and damnation, as will their progeny...","Genre(s): Strategy, General, General",56.0,7.3,Idea Factory,PlayStation 3,"Jun 26, 2012",T

ROBOT RESCUE REVOLUTION,"In Robot Rescue Revolution your mission is to maneuver a bunch of wacky robots that have been trapped in deadly labyrinths to the exit and ultimately save them from a disastrous ending. Each labyrinth is full of interactive items from teleports to mines that either help in cracking the puzzles or are consequently lethal. Sounds simple, right? Well don't be fooled by its simplicity just yet as there is more to this game than meets the eye.

RobotRescueRevolution_Screen2

The twist in this game of strategy and logic is that each and every robot shares linked controls. This means that you can't move each robot individually, rather each and every move you make will cause all the robots to move simultaneously in the same direction- and here is where the fun begins!

Besides cracking the puzzles on your own there is also the option to play with a friend in Two-Player mode which is broken down into co-op and split screen modes. In Co-op mode you and a buddy can play on the same screen and work together to crack the puzzles, bringing the robots back to safety. Or if you're feeling a little competitive you can challenge a friend in Duel mode where you will battle it out on identical but separate maps seeing who solves the puzzle and makes it to the finish line first.

Robot Rescue Revolution also lets you take a backseat to all the brain-bending puzzles by giving you a chance to be the mastermind behind your own maps. With Map Editor you can design your own maps and upload them online, sharing them with the rest of the Robot Rescue community. Oh! And don't forget about earning all the Robot Rescue Revolution trophies for your PlayStation Trophy Cabinet!","Genre(s): Miscellaneous, Puzzle, Action",,tbd,Teyon,PlayStation 3,"Jan 28, 2014",

TOM CLANCY'S HAWX,"Tom Clancy's HAWX (high-altitude warfare) promises to revolutionize the way players think about combat in the sky. The story begins in the year 2012. As the era of the nation-state draws quickly to a close, the rules of warfare evolve even more rapidly. More and more nations become increasingly dependent on private military companies (PMCs), elite mercenaries with a lax view of the law. The Reykjavik Accords further legitimize their existence by authorizing their right to serve in every aspect of military operations. While the benefits of such PMCs are apparent, growing concerns surrounding giving them too much power begin to mount. The Enhanced Reality System is the backbone of the HAWX flight experience: radars and incoming missile detection, anti-crash system, damage control system, tactical map and information relay, and weapons trajectory control. E.R.S. also allows players to issue orders to their squadron, making this system as iconic to HAWX as the Cross-Com system is to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. Players can ease into their flight missions and gain a level of comfort with the use of the assistance mode. Once employed, players can take full advantage of their technological support through the E.R.S and gain maximum piloting security. If the situation calls for the player to unleash the full potential of the aircraft, the assistance mode can be switched off and all safety features will be deactivated. For the first time ever in the air-combat genre, players can experience the entire solo campaign in four-player JUMP IN co-op mode. In PVP mode, players can challenge up to 15 friends in intense dogfighting sessions and find out who's the top gun. Winning players are rewarded with experience points and money to unlock more weapons. Players have the opportunity to take the throttle of over 50 of the world's most famous aircrafts, as well as being able to dogfight over realistic modern landscapes that have endured years of post-war trauma.
