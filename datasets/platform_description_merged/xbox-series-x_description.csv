"""BUY THE GAME, I HAVE A GUN"" -SHEESH-MAN","This game is worth every penny, and you should buy it right now, why? Firstly because the whole story was written during a live-stream, which makes the story totally nonsensical! If this doesn't convince you remember that not only do I have a gun, I also know all your secrets. This is of course a joke, I do not know your secrets, yet. The game even features some of the most famous actors to have ever lived, including ""Thrash94Gaming"" you might know him for never being in a movie. ""LaraCroft86"" you might know her for also not being in any movie. Lastly but mostly least ""Gamer Jeffro"" for his famous role as Asa Gray in the video game that you are about to buy. Thankfully this game also includes two actors from Kimulator's Films, sadly they also were never in anything noteworthy.

You might wonder who I am, well I'm Sheesh-Man, I literally come from another planet, I'm like an alien, a spooky sheeshing alien to say the truth. Don't challenge me or I will sheesh your whole family, including your dog, it's not a threat, it's a fact.

Now back to the game, it features over 2 hours of video footage of me and my worst enemy Swag-Girl, who even says Swag in 2023? Pft, we all know Sheeshing is the new hip and cool thing to do.

This game is an interactive movie telling the story of how I went on earth and became a super-hero or whatever, it's pretty sick if you ask me! Not sick in the sense that you will throw up, but in the sense that it's cool. This my friend was a word play, you can expect this level of humour in the game, may I say it even gets better than this, not a lot, but at least a little bit.

The game as a ton of bonus content too! Even a video of Mini the dog taking a shower, can you believe it? I surely can, because it's true and it's literally in the game.

Either way, I don't think you need more reasons to buy the game but I will give you another one, this game includes 4 PSN Avatars! Use them to show all your friends that you are indeed the best gamer of the gamers.","Genre(s): Adventure, General",,tbd,Kimulator's Films inc.,PlayStation 4,"Jan 29, 2023",M

The Cthulhu Mythos has been fascinating audiences for generations, growing to become one of the largest shared universes ever envisioned and giving birth to countless stories, novels, movies, tabletop and videogames since the original publication of H.P. Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu. Adaptions and references have formed a widespread legacy stretching back to the very beginning of the 20th century, latching on to the key fear of the human psyche: that of the unknown.

Strange creatures, weird science, and shadowy cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything. Your mind will suffer -- balancing a razor-thin line between sanity and madness, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Creeping shadows hide lurking figures... and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.","Genre(s): Role-Playing, Action Adventure, General, Survival",63.0,7.1,Cyanide,PlayStation 4,"Oct 30, 2018",M

F. Norris: A runaway ninja whose past is a mystery. He's the one who mastered the ninjutsu style known as ""the forbidden technique"".

Story:
In a far future, Earth was devastated by mutants who took control after a worldwide catastrophic event known as ""the big pulse"", a global scale electromagnetic pulse that put an end to all electronic technology on the planet. Humans are now enslaved by mutants led by ""The Boss"" in a world ruled by ""the law of the jungle"".
However, not everything is lost two humans and a mutant rebel are willing to fight in order to stop this madness. Will they be strong enough? Well... that's up to you!

Main Characters:
Gal: A girl who escaped from traders of humans. She's an expert in her own kick-boxing-derived martial art. While her attacks don't have a long reach, her speed and agility have no equal and her technique and endurance are pretty good too. She is capable of avoiding almost every attack, an ability that comes in handy when facing multiple foes.

Ricardo: A minotaur human-rights activist and a powerful wrestler. He's not very fast and his technique isn't as good as his comrades', but he has a pretty long reach, and his power and endurance are amazing. He's capable of destroying any enemy in record time!

F. Norris: A runaway ninja whose past is a mystery. He's the one who mastered the ninjutsu style known as ""the forbidden technique"". While he might be pretty fragile compared to Gal or Ricardo, he has a great combination of reach, power and speed, plus an amazing technique that (when mastered) can take control of any situation.

A long time ago...

In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.
The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.
...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames,
a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.

The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.
Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.
And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.
While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.

In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.
To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.

LA-MULANA 2,"La-Mulana 2 features sprawling ancient ruins, mind-boggling mysteries, untold numbers of items, and terrible enemies combining to form what is possibly the perfect Metroidvania-style ""archaeological ruin exploration action game"".

In La-Mulana 2, you take on the role of Lumisa Kosugi - daughter of the previous title's hero - as she explores the ancient ruins of La-Mulana, said to be the cradle of human civilization. Desperate to find the cause of the numerous recent appearances of monsters from the ruins, Lumisa heads to the ""other"" La-Mulana: the ruins known as Eg-Lana.

Explore the vast ruins comprising multiple field maps, solve mysteries and riddles using the stone tablets and messages you discover along the way, and take out huge monsters known as ""Guardians"" as you make your way to the deepest depths of the ruins.

You won't believe the awesome mystery of Eg-Lana awaiting you at the end of your journey...

ABOUT LA-MULANA 2:
La-Mulana was known as a ""Metroidvania""-style game (a 2D action platformer with an emphasis on non-linear exploration). That said, the real core of the game is in deciphering the riddles scattered throughout the game, and solving the puzzles that exist as part of the ruins.

A classic experience: As with its predecessor, La-Mulana 2 will not feature a tutorial or a long-winded sidekick. As a seasoned explorer, it's up to you to discover the secrets hidden within the ruins and find the truth on your own.

Explore at your own pace: By deciphering cryptic text on the monuments scattered throughout the ruins, you will gradually unravel the mystery of the ruins. Which parts of the sprawling underground you tackle, and in what order, is up to you. Sometimes you will need to use changes in backgrounds, mysterious sounds, the strength of enemies, or the sneakiness of traps to detect subtle changes in your surroundings.

A colossal adventure: We have designed a variety of zones, and have created a mystery deep enough to encompass a gigantic cave system. This is a very large-scale indie title. We predict newcomers to the series will probably be able to clear the game in 20 to 30 hours. Because of the non-linear nature of Eg-Lana, La-Mulana 2 will have plenty of replayability.

New horrors, new weapons: Plenty of ferocious and terrifying monsters and guardians stand in your way in the depths of this new underground network. Fortunately, you will also have an arsenal of tools and weapons at your disposal to help you on your journey.

Widescreen support: The first La-Mulana was a remake of a retro-style game that ran in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which made widescreen support impossible. For La-Mulana 2, the various maps and rooms are designed to be 16:9-compatible, making it perfect for widescreen TVs and monitors.

The question we've asked ourselves throughout development is: ""How can we make an old-school 2D game take advantage of advancements in present-day technology?""

GAME FEATURES:
* Become an adventurer and explore sprawling ancient ruins
* Gather hints to solve the various mysteries of the ruins
* Dive into the action as you fight off tough enemies seeking to impede your progress
* A detailed and beautifully dot-rendered world
* Seven main weapons and over ten sub-weapons
* Over 60 items of various types to help you explore the ruins
* Over 20 apps to install on your trusty adventurer's tablet, the ""Mobile Super X3""
* Includes reference book with over 200 monsters and other characters in the game

GAME CHARACTERS:
* Lumisa Kosugi (21 years old; fourth-generation Japanese; the game's protagonist)
Some say she is Lemeza's wife's daughter from a previous marriage, while others believe she's Professor Shawn's illegitimate child. Either way, she is a Kosugi; that much is clear. She travels to La-Mulana to make her archaeological debut after accepting Xelpud's request to search the ruins.

* Lemeza Kosugi (36 years old; the previous game's protagonist)
Tales of his exploits in the ruins of La-Mulana may be known worldwide, but he was also responsible for the ruins' destruction, and has gone into hiding as a result. His love of exploration has not faded, however, and he still finds time to go spelunking in secret.

* Shawn Kosugi (67 years old)
After revealing the ""Treasure of All Life"" he brought back from the ruins of La-Mulana, he returned to a hermetic life once more. Although he technically retired after finishing his research on the ""Cradle of All Civilization"", he finds himself slowly drawn back into the world of archaeology.

* Elder Xelpud (Age unknown)
Upon the collapse of the La-Mulana ruins, his life as a 7th Child came to an end. He's been spending his time running the ""La-Mulana Ruins Tourist Spot"" in hopes of finding purpose in life once again. As a result, he's become quite wealthy, and now lives a life of luxury full of beautiful women and fast cars.

* Mulbruk (3024 years old; looks/hopes to look about 24)
Since her release from the ruins, Mulbruk has been happily living aboveground, pretending to be a ""normal"" young woman. Using her amazing knowledge of history, she has become a treasure hunter.

LANGRISSER I & II,"Langrisser I - Long ago, there was a terrible war over a legendary sword said to grant its wielder unlimited power. The blood of those who vowed to protect it and those who sought its power for themselves permeated the battlefields of El Sallia. That sword is known as Langrisser. Of those who swore to protect it, the royal family of Baldea has safeguarded it from the world for many generations. Thanks to Baldea, tales of Langrisser soon faded from memory.
However, Baldea's sworn duty would be called to action once again. Motivated by power and the conviction to rule the world, Kaiser Digos and the Dalsis Empire he commanded invade Baldea, seeking the enticing power of Langrisser. Ledin, the prince of Baldea, narrowly escapes the invasion, and devises a way to avenge his father, who had been killed by Kaiser Digos.
Now, Ledin must reclaim Langrisser, which his ancestors fought so valiantly to protect—thus beginning his journey that will test his loyalty to the Light.

Langrisser II - It has been centuries since the War of the Sacred Sword razed El Sallia. Now, incessant violence plagues the continent. Isolated battles arise all across the land, ravaging towns and nations, before creeping to the next. The Kingdom of Baldea is but a legend, and Langrisser is no more than a fairytale.

Minorities weren’t welcome, especially after dark. “Just like the main game, we wanted to capture a snapshot of a specific time and place in American history, and let the player experience it.” Since Sinclair Parish is a small rural township in the countryside near the Bayou, expect lots of opportunities to tear through turns, jump gaps and run from the law.

TERRA LANDER II - ROCKSLIDE RESCUE,"Navigate the player to the landing pad through increasingly difficult levels within the time limit and with enough fuel. Movement or firing uses up fuel, though levels can be replenished by shooting the fuel dumps. Running out of fuel means you loose control and can't fire. If all fuel dumps are destroyed on any given level the player's fuel tank capacity is doubled for the next level (this does not apply to starting from the highest level reached).

Avoid obstacles or lift them out of the way with the tractor beam. Avoid the obstacles and enemy fire while navigating the terrain. Don't land too fast...make sure it's a soft landing.

When all the humanoids are collected, fly high above the planet to escape, making sure you have enough fuel. Keep an eye on fuel levels and destroy fuel dumps to replenish.

When all levels are complete, they repeat with a slightly higher difficulty setting.

When a life is lost the player is temporarily shielded against enemy fire, this is represented by an electrical circular field around the lander just after it is respawned.

In Terra Lander II your ship has been upgraded with a force field. Therefore, you have a limited amount on health, but not much so be carfefull!","Genre(s): Action, General, Arcade",,tbd,Funbox Media,PlayStation 4,"Jul 17, 2020",E

While capturing the twitch gameplay of their predecessors, they're brought to you in glorious HD using vector graphics to provide clean, never pixelated graphics and advanced Newtonian physics. Terra Lander, Terra Lander II - Rockslide Rescue, and Terra Bomber each offer the familiar boops and beeps that will inspire fond memories in veteran players while newcomers will appreciate the improved graphics, visual effects, and controls they come to expect from current-gen games.

Terra Lander is a two-dimensional sideways scroller inspired by the classic arcade shooters of the 1980s. Navigate your ship to the landing pad through twenty increasingly difficult levels within the time limit and without running out of fuel. Avoid the moving doors and increasingly fiendish enemies, and find the switches for the doors that block your way.

Movement and firing uses up fuel throughout the level, and running out means you lose controls and cannot fire. Replenish your tank by shooting the fuel dumps, and if all fuel dumps are destroyed on any given level the player's fuel tank capacity is doubled for the next level (except in practice mode.).

Don't touch anything--that would be fatal!

Terra Lander II - Rockslide Rescue is the sequel to Terra Lander in which players must rescue humanoids from various landing pads across the planet. Complete ten levels of increasing difficulty within the time limit by rescuing all of the humanoids and flying above the planet to escape. Movement and firing projectiles use up fuel, so keeping an eye on your fuel levels is highly encouraged. Replenishing fuel can be done by shooting fuel dumps, but if pilots find themselves with an empty gas tank, they’ll lose control of their craft and be unable to fire missiles.

In Terra Bomber, you will pilot your craft across ten increasingly difficult terrains while avoiding the various gun positions, rockets and baddies with only one objective: to destroy the base and the end of the level! Use your guns and bombs which can be bolstered by collecting power ups, and maintain a sharp eye on your fuel levels, keeping them topped up by destroying the fuel dumps.","Genre(s): Miscellaneous, Compilation",,tbd,Dark Computer Entertainment Limited,PlayStation 4,"Apr 27, 2021",E

An immigrant who never found her roots in a city of immigrants. A chainsmoker whose favorite pastime is staring blankly at the streets through the windows of a fast food joint at 4AM. The sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach tells you that you're doomed, and distorted voices from the shadows seem to agree. The curse of your clan makes interacting with everyday technology difficult. Dissociation is your natural state.

But when New York's Anarch leader meets a gruesome end, out of all the bloodsuckers in the metropolis, you're the one picked to investigate. Make no mistake: this is obviously a trap, yet another move in the horrible game of Jyhad, the eternal struggle for power between warring vampire generations. But you're Lasombra, and if there's one thing you know, it's this: if the Ventrue Prince and her followers underestimate you, they're going to deeply regret it.

"""BUY THE GAME, I HAVE A GUN"" -SHEESH-MAN","This game is worth every penny, and you should buy it right now, why? Firstly because the whole story was written during a live-stream, which makes the story totally nonsensical! If this doesn't convince you remember that not only do I have a gun, I also know all your secrets. This is of course a joke, I do not know your secrets, yet. The game even features some of the most famous actors to have ever lived, including ""Thrash94Gaming"" you might know him for never being in a movie. ""LaraCroft86"" you might know her for also not being in any movie. Lastly but mostly least ""Gamer Jeffro"" for his famous role as Asa Gray in the video game that you are about to buy. Thankfully this game also includes two actors from Kimulator's Films, sadly they also were never in anything noteworthy.

You might wonder who I am, well I'm Sheesh-Man, I literally come from another planet, I'm like an alien, a spooky sheeshing alien to say the truth. Don't challenge me or I will sheesh your whole family, including your dog, it's not a threat, it's a fact.

Now back to the game, it features over 2 hours of video footage of me and my worst enemy Swag-Girl, who even says Swag in 2023? Pft, we all know Sheeshing is the new hip and cool thing to do.

This game is an interactive movie telling the story of how I went on earth and became a super-hero or whatever, it's pretty sick if you ask me! Not sick in the sense that you will throw up, but in the sense that it's cool. This my friend was a word play, you can expect this level of humour in the game, may I say it even gets better than this, not a lot, but at least a little bit.

The game as a ton of bonus content too! Even a video of Mini the dog taking a shower, can you believe it? I surely can, because it's true and it's literally in the game.

Either way, I don't think you need more reasons to buy the game but I will give you another one, this game includes 4 PSN Avatars! Use them to show all your friends that you are indeed the best gamer of the gamers.","Genre(s): Adventure, General",,tbd,Kimulator's Films inc.,PlayStation 4,"Jan 29, 2023",M
