DON'T FEED THE ANIMALS,"[DSiWare] Don't Feed The Animals is a strategic defense game about children who have been hoarding their treats all summer in their backyard fort. They've attracted the attention of the local wildlife (the backyard is on the edge of a forest). To defend their treasure, the kids use all the materials at their disposal to create three types of robots: melee, sound and water bots. These bots act like a tower does in a tower defense game, keeping the enemy from the base. Each bot has certain strengths and weaknesses against different enemies. The enemies include bears, raccoons, rabbits, turtles and cats. Play through 50 levels consisting of waves of animals - increasing in difficulty - who attempt to steal the candy. Should a creature reach the base, it will take a treat; this treat must be recovered or it will be lost. Should a boss reach the base, the game is lost. Successfully fend off the animals so the children can enjoy their end-of-summer feast.","Genre(s): Action, Beat-'Em-Up, Beat-'Em-Up",N/A,tbd,Electron Jump Games,N/A,"Apr 26, 2010",E

FIFA SOCCER 10,"On the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that FIFA Soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction between players. In addition, players now move, behave and position themselves more realistically. On attack, players analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better-urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10. In goal, a myriad of improvements and refinements to goalkeeper intelligence result in a more responsive and powerful rushing system and ultra-realistic saves. Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive soccer experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA Soccer 10. Three new innovations revealed today at E3 have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360 degree dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
FIFA Soccer 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.

Knowing that fate itself has ordained him as her true love, she confesses her desire to share in his exciting life... Only to be flat out rejected. He tells her, ""If it is truly your desire is to be with an adventurer such as me, I would ask you first to do something with that long hair. Cast aside that frilly dress, and don a suit of armor.

There are no instructions, and you encounter no living beings but soon realize your actions may help individuals who are somehow trapped in a parallel dimension. You don't so much play Myst, as experience it. Of course you must solve a multitude of puzzles, mazes, and problems, but Myst's principal attractions are its environment and the underlying intrafamily drama that unfolds as you explore. Unlike most adventure games, Myst offers no inventory, no death, and no dialogue. Although puzzles don't seem to have much direct connection to the game, they share a commonality. They take on many forms but follow a consistent thread. Some puzzles are very challenging, even obtuse, creating an odd paradox: many buy Myst, but few complete it. It is immensely popular, but most nonadventurers quit in frustration. Fortunately, Myst's popularity has spawned several online sites for hints, walk-throughs, and even saved games . The nonlinear gameplay of Myst lets players go anywhere at any time. Unlike other adventure games, Myst has no inventory, and players never die. Incredibly detailed, Myst offers more depth than any other CD-ROM game to date.

Do you know your walking routine? helps you work out if your activity rhythm is up to scratch and provides valuable insight on how to set up a regular routine - the healthiest way to live! All you need to do is clip one of the Activity Meters onto your belt, put it in your pocket or even attach it to your dog’s collar and you’re away! The Activity Meter will then keep track of every step you make during the day and transmit the information to your Nintendo DS, which is where the fun starts! Using the Touch Screen and your DS Stylus, you can use the results in all sorts of ways and even make notes for your own records. The first thing to do is to check out your activity rhythm, or walking habits, and see if the duration, timing and number of steps are all the best they can be. You can set yourself a Step Target, aiming for as many or as few steps as you think you can manage. Then have a look at the Records section, where your performance result is presented in several clear and concise graphs. The Activity Meter will provide helpful comments on whether you achieved your target and will even compare your walking performance to an animal! The game will also set you fun Mini Targets after your results have been checked - perhaps to avoid fatty foods for the day, or maybe just to relax and treat yourself. Unlike a regular pedometer, one of the great things about the Activity Meter is that it allows your family, friends and even pets to join in. Up to four different people can use their own Activity Meter in conjunction with a single Game Card, allowing everyone’s results to be compared and promoting a bit of healthy competition. For the first time on Nintendo DS, Walk with me! users can use Miis to represent themselves.

Erase all the viruses and you win, but if the screen gets filled with the emerging viruses you lose. Note: there is a twist to this system that gives depth to the game play. Viruses turn to stone if left alone for a while, which cannot be selected to form a triangle. However, these stones can be erased if they are within a triangle that you create. With a little luck and practice players can rake in massive points by letting the viruses turn to stones and erasing them all at once.

RAINBOW ISLANDS REVOLUTION,"(Also known as ""New Rainbow Islands"") Rainbow Islands Revolution is an update of a Rainbow Islands, the sequel to Bubble Bobble, taking the form of a platform game where the player must ascend through vertical levels that are slowly sinking into the ocean. The objective of the source material is to reach the top of each level, taking out any enemies in the way by firing magical rainbows that can trap or eliminate foes as well as providing bridges for the player to walk on. Rainbows remain onscreen for a short amount of time but can be ?broken? by the player if they jump on them. Once broken, the rainbow will fall off the screen, taking out the first enemy it touches. The game also features a pleasing bonus item system where dispatched enemies leave behind items of food that have varying point values and power-ups that have a range of helpful effects. The major feature of this re-interpretation is shifting the entire game away from traditional controls by implementing a global touchscreen control system which radically alters the way in which the game plays. The game is also displayed across both screens of the DS. Rather than being fired by a button press, rainbows are now drawn directly onto the gameplay area using the stylus and movement is executed by dragging the player?s character around the levels. The objective is still to reach the top of the level, but the time limit has been extended to account for the player being unable to move and use rainbows simultaneously. Rainbows are now broken by pressing the stylus onto them. [Atari]","Genre(s): Action, Platformer, Platformer, 2D, 2D",54,tbd,Marvelous Entertainment,N/A,"Oct 3, 2006",E
