Set to revolutionise multi-terrain, multi-vehicle racing, FUEL is a fiercely competitive game without boundaries. On and off-road, two and four-wheeled vehicles race a massively diverse environment, from scaling the highest snow-capped mountain to racing the deepest arid canyon. In a fictional present, vast swathes of the United States have been ravaged by the extreme effects of accelerated global warming: tornados, brush fires, hurricanes and tsunamis have driven people from their homes leaving huge areas of America abandoned. Now these dangerous areas have created the perfect playground for a new breed of adrenaline junkies who set out to conquer each other, and Mother Nature, in closely fought races. There are over 70 different vehicles with which to take on any challenge that FUEL’s stunning environment throws at you. On-road and off-road bikes, cars, quads, trucks, buggies and dragsters take dangerous short-cuts, perform death-defying jumps and tear through spectacular cross-over points. FUEL's landscape is powered by cutting-edge technology and, using satellite data, features some of the most exciting and inspiring areas of America - including the Grand Canyon, Yosemite National Park, Mount Rainier and much more. In FUEL, if you can see it, you can drive to it, taking any route - on or off-road - that you want. With a draw distance of 40KM, 100,000 miles of roads, tracks and trails and hundreds of race events FUEL’s epic world demands to be explored. [Codmasters]"

Ignite (2011),racing,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/ignite-2011,"In Ignite every race is different. Each race brings something new as you try winning the race by using any of the strategies or switch between them during the race. The key factor in the game is the SCORE. You collect score while racing. Every stunt that you perform will award you with a certain number of score. Hitting objects, driving fast, drifting they all give you a certain number of score. When you reach 1000 you can burn away your score as nitro thus getting an edge over the others. If you are in the lead you can hit more objects thus gather more score. However hitting objects may cause you to make a mistake and crash into something that is immovable. If you can be patient and gather more than 2000 score, your nitro will be even stronger. Another tactic is to select one of the super cars which are fast and have a good traction. In this case you won't gather that much score but most probably you won't need it because you don't need nitro to stay ahead. Another way to win is to gather your score and never burn it since at the end all score points are converted to time and is subtracted from your overall time and you may jump ahead the winner."
