With danger closing in, Kait Diaz breaks away to uncover her connection to the enemy and discovers the true danger to Sera herself. CHARACTERS: Kait Diaz Kait was born and raised beyond the COG's formal jurisdiction. Her mother, Reyna, was the leader of her isolated Outsider village. Yet Kait also has deep family ties to the COG: her late father was a widely admired lieutenant colonel during the Pendulum Wars and her uncle, Oscar, was a highly decorated frontline Gear in the early years of the Locust War. Even after her induction into the COG, her true loyalties are unknown, even to her. Kait's Necklace Kait hasn't told anyone about the Locust necklace her mother gave her before she died and the pressure of this secret is eating her alive. JD Fenix The son of Marcus Fenix and Anya Stroud, JD grew up surrounded by stories of his war-hero parents. Unfortunately, an incident at Settlement 2 left JD deeply disillusioned with the COG, after which he and his best friend, Del, went AWOL and joined an Outsider village. After helping to fight back the Swarm's initial push, JD has once again attracted the interest of First Minister Jinn, much to his father's and friends' dismay. Del Walker Del lost both his parents in the difficult aftermath of the Locust War and was siphoned into a boarding school, where he met JD Fenix. As a young officer, Del was part of a disastrous mission at the COG's Settlement 2, which shattered his faith in First Minister Jinn's government. Although Del recognizes the need to fight with the COG in the aftermath of the Swarm's emergence, he is not necessarily thrilled to be doing soand he is wholly unprepared to learn details about the Settlement 2 incident that JD has kept from him. Marcus Fenix After the Locust War, Marcus played a limited role in the COG, even though his wife, Anya, initially led the government. After Anya's death, it became clear that the COG would favor authoritarian control over civic-minded rebuilding. Now that he and JD have been reunited, Marcus finds himself once again fighting for the COG, but his frustrations with authority, and conflicts with his son, remain ever present.

Fracture,third-person,https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/fracture,"Amidst a backdrop of worldwide ecological and seismological chaos in the mid-2100s, the United States has been split in two by the ""Great Flood"". As a result of the polar ice cap melting, the Mississippi River has destroyed the central portion of the United States, causing an ill-equipped Federal Government to fail and literally cutting the country in half. These two halves are left to fend for themselves in the aftermath. The East, now known as the Atlantic Alliance, symbolic of their union with Europe, puts its faith in surviving this new world in cybernetics, an established yet evolving technology now more than 150 years old. On the other side of the flooded continent, the Western states, now called the Republic of Pacifica and having allied with Asia, resort to solving their problems at the genetic level, effectively restructuring the DNA of its inhabitants -- a method the Atlantic Alliance finds morally reprehensible. By 2161, it only takes a hint of unauthorized military preparation in Pacifica for the newly restored president to order a strike in the heart of Pacifican territory -- an outpost in the now dry San Francisco Bay. This strike leads to the unthinkable: an epic conflict with global implications fought on U.S. soil. As a soldier in this struggle, Mason Briggs uses explosive, terrain-deforming weaponry to change the face of battle: He not only destroys the land in his path, he outright transforms it to gain the strategic advantage in completely unscripted ways no game has ever seen. With such a devastating arsenal at hand, Briggs never leaves any battlefield the way he found it. In addition to weaponry that allows players to do things previously only imagined, each side of the conflict, Pacifica and the Atlantic Alliance, boast soldiers with powers beyond those of ordinary men. Genetic augmentations provide Pacifican forces with amazing abilities, while Atlantic Alliance soldiers like Briggs counter the threat with the more ""traditional"" method: cybernetics. The differing states of superhumanity result in balanced yet stylistically different combat tactics that have never been seen before. [LucasArts]"
